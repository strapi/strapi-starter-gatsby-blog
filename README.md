The CLI will create a monorepo, install dependencies, and run your project automatically.

The Strapi backend server will run here => [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)

## Deploying to production

You will need to deploy the `frontend` and `backend` projects separately. Here are the docs to deploy each one:

- [Deploy Strapi](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment.html#hosting-provider-guides)
- [Deploy Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/deploying-and-hosting/)

Don't forget to setup the environment variables on your production app:

For the frontend the following environment variable is required:
